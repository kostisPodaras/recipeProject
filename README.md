# recipeProject
Modern Javascript(ES6, Webpack 4, Babel etc)
-Enter the food you are looking for.
-An AJAX request is sent to the recipe API | food2fork (note the free acount limits the API calls to 50/day).
-Then the top 30 recipies are rendered to the left column.
-By choosing a recipe another request is sent to the recipe API and we recieve the recipe data (ingredients, img, publisher etc).
-The results are then rendered to the main area.
-Clicking the add to shopping list button manipulates the ingredients and render them to the right column where we can delete them, increase-decrease
their units etc
(for example if a pizza we want needs 10gr of salt and 2 tomatoe sauce and we have the salt or a portion of the salt we can delete the salt from the shopping
cart or decrease it to 5gr)
